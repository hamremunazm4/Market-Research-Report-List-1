<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Backwater Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Normally Open Backwater Valves</li><li>Normally Closed Backwater Valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The backwater valves market features two primary types: normally open and normally closed backwater valves. Normally open backwater valves allow sewage to flow freely under normal conditions but close automatically during backflow, preventing flooding. Conversely, normally closed backwater valves remain sealed until a specific pressure or backflow occurs, ensuring no sewage enters the system unless necessary. Both types play a critical role in managing wastewater, protecting properties from sewage backups, and ensuring efficient drainage in urban infrastructure.</p></p>
