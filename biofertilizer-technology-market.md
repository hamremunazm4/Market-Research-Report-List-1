<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biofertilizer Technology Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid</li><li>Carrier-based Biofertilizer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The biofertilizer technology market is divided into two main types: liquid and carrier-based biofertilizers. Liquid biofertilizers are formulations that contain live microorganisms suspended in a liquid medium, allowing for easy application and quick soil assimilation. They enhance nutrient solubilization and plant growth. Carrier-based biofertilizers, on the other hand, involve microorganisms impregnated on solid materials, facilitating prolonged shelf life and gradual nutrient release. Both types aim to improve soil fertility, boost crop yields, and promote sustainable agricultural practices.</p></p>
