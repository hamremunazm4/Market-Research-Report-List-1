<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Onsite Nitrogen Generation Units Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Membrane Nitrogen Generators</li><li>PSA Nitrogen Generators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Onsite nitrogen generation units are essential for industries requiring a reliable nitrogen supply. The market primarily consists of two types: membrane nitrogen generators and PSA (Pressure Swing Adsorption) nitrogen generators. Membrane generators utilize polymer membranes to separate nitrogen from compressed air, offering continuous supply at lower purity levels. PSA generators, on the other hand, leverage adsorption processes to produce high-purity nitrogen by alternately pressurizing and depressurizing an adsorbent material, making them suitable for applications needing higher nitrogen purity levels.</p></p>
