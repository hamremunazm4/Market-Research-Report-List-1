<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Prenatal DNA Sequencing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Genetic Disorders</li><li>Nonhereditary Disease</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The prenatal DNA sequencing market is divided into two primary types: genetic disorders and nonhereditary diseases. Genetic disorders include conditions typically inherited from parents, like cystic fibrosis and Down syndrome, detectable through prenatal tests. Nonhereditary diseases encompass conditions that arise from environmental factors or mutations occurring during fetal development, such as certain cancers. Both segments focus on early detection of abnormalities, aiding parents in making informed decisions about their pregnancy and potential interventions.</p></p>
