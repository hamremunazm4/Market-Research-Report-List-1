<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rolling Guide Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Roller Type</li><li>Ball Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rolling guide markets are classified into two main types: roller type and ball type. Roller type guides use cylindrical rollers to facilitate smooth movement and load distribution, making them ideal for heavy-duty applications. They typically offer better stability and can support larger loads. In contrast, ball type guides employ balls that move within grooves, providing a low-friction surface for precise linear motion. While ball types are often used for lighter loads and higher speeds, roller types excel in load capacity and durability.</p></p>
